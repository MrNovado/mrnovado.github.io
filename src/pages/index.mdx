This is my personal page and is a hub/repository for my projects, experiments, notes and all sort of useful stuff I found interesting, intriguing, or whatever.

I'm a front-end developer with a 8+ years of experience. I've been mostly doing **web** and **android**.

Currently, I'm fascinated with modern hybrid-stacks like [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/), [ElectronJS](https://electronjs.org/), [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), and such. I think they are the future of cross-platform development.

I love [React](https://reactjs.org/) and everything around it. I'm also interested in _modern functional_ ecosystems with **if-it-compiles-it-works** features: [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). I've also crushed into [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) and statecharts recently in a big way.

> It's really cool when your stuff just works, right?
