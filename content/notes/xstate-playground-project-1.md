# [xstate-playground](https://github.com/MrNovado/xstate-playground)

Some experiments and examples using [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) library. Most notable is the `tic-tac-toe` game with AI: the `perfect` one is an implementation of the Newell and Simon's expert model. The `perfect` AI is implemented in a declarative way, while others are imperative. You can also choose to play manually for either side.

`Statefull buttons` is an experiment around state-styling. And `ping-pong` is an mvp implementation of an actor-model. Check the [code](https://github.com/MrNovado/xstate-playground) to see what's up.

Here's the [live demo](https://mrnovado.github.io/xstate-playground/#/):
